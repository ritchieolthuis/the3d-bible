  /** Builds a real BVH for every mesh of a RAYCAST_PROXY_STRUCTURES model in a
   *  background worker (three-mesh-bvh's GenerateMeshBVHWorker), off the main
   *  thread, then swaps `model.raycastMeshes` from the coarse box proxy (see
   *  buildRaycastProxy) to the real mesh list in place. Fire-and-forget: the
   *  box proxy keeps serving hover/click/occlusion queries until this
   *  resolves, so nothing needs to wait on it. If the model gets swapped out
   *  or disposed before this finishes, `model.raycastMeshes` may already be
   *  stale by the time we'd write to it - guarded by checking `this.current`
   *  and the model's own meshes are still live (not much of a cost either way
   *  since a disposed geometry just gets an unused boundsTree attached).
   *
   *  Builds against a detached CLONE of each mesh's position/index arrays,
   *  never the live geometry directly. GenerateMeshBVHWorker.generate()
   *  transfers (not copies) the ArrayBuffers it's given to the worker
   *  thread, which detaches them on the main thread the instant the call is
   *  made - a mesh mid-render loses its vertex data and renders as nothing
   *  the moment its buffer gets transferred, well before the BVH result (or
   *  the replacement array the worker sends back) is ready. Building on a
   *  clone means only the clone's arrays get detached; the visible mesh's
   *  geometry is never touched until the finished boundsTree is attached to
   *  it directly. Safe to reattach as-is (skipping the worker helper's own
   *  array-replacement step, which only applies to the clone) because
   *  `indirect: true` keeps the BVH's own triangle-index mapping separate
   *  from geometry.index instead of reordering it in place - the clone and
   *  the original still describe identical triangles in identical order. */
